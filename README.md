        If you already have Eclipse and WPILIB, skip to step 3.

Setup:

1. First, if you have not already done so, you need to download Eclipse Neon.2. There are a couple of different versions, based off of what you need, ex. web development, but here is the link to the standard download. [Mac](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/oomph/epp/neon/R2a/eclipse-inst-mac64.tar.gz), [PC](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/neon2) (Choose the appropriate download link for your pc. (32 bit vs. 64 bit))

2. Download and install wpilib software on Eclipse.

    a. Open Eclipse.

    b. Click on Help -> Install New Software. At this point, a new window should open, that looks like this. ![Alt text](InstallNewSoftware.png?raw=true "Install New Software")
    c. Click on Add... 

    d. You should be taken to this, other, window. 
    ![Alt text](AddSoftware.png?raw=true "Add Software")

    e. For Name, type in something like FRC or WPILIB, so that you know that it is the software for robotics.

    f. For Location, paste in the following URL: [WPILIB Software](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/eclipse/)

    g. Click OK, and then install the software. Make sure to only install the software for Java Development, because the C/C++ Software is not neccessary for us.
3. Download the CTRE 3rd Party Library.

    a. [Windows Users](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/installers/CTRE%20Toolsuite%20v4.4.1.8.zip) Click on the link to download the installer, and follow its instructions.

    b. [Mac Users](http://www.ctr-electronics.com//downloads/lib/CTRE_FRCLibs_NON-WINDOWS.zip) Unzip the file, and go into it. Copy the folder called java. Navigate to your home, and go into the wpilib folder. Click on user, and replace the java folder there with the one you copied.
